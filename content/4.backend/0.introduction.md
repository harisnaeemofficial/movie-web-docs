# Introduction to the backend

The backend is essentially just an account server. There is not much more to it.

## Metrics

The backend exposes Prometheus metrics, it can be accessed on `/metrics`.

## Security

Optionally, there are a few security settings:
- Recaptcha support, the server can verify Recaptcha v3 tokens on register and login.
- Rate-limits. Some expensive endpoints have rate-limits, but only when enabled. This requires an additional Redis connection.

## Migrations

To run migrations, You can use the command `pnpm migration:up` inside the docker container.

Alternatively, you can enabled `postgres.migrateOnBoot` and it will be migrated automatically on boot.
