There are a few configurations of hosting movie-web. Each with their own benefits.
**If you don't know what to choose, go with method 1.**

## Method 1 - Only host the frontend
With this method, you only host the essential parts that make movie-web work. But keep using the account server from official movie-web.
This method is the easiest to self-host and is recommended for most users.

1. [Set up the Proxy!](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md)
2. [Set up the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)

## Method 2 - Only host the account server
If you want to own your own data, it's possible to self-host just the account server and nothing else.
This method is only recommended if you have experience hosting databases or other similar stateful applications.

1. [Set up the Backend!](../4.backend/1.deploy.md)
2. [Configure the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)

## Method 3 - Host everything
If you want an instance that's completely isolated from official movie-web. You can self-host all parts.
This method is not recommended for inexperienced hosters.

1. [Set up the Proxy!](../2.proxy/1.deploy.md)
2. [Set up the Backend!](../4.backend/1.deploy.md)
3. [Set up the Client!](../3.client/1.deploy.md)
